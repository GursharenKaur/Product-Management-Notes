## What is Market Research?

Market research means collecting and analyzing information about your market—like buyers, sellers, and industry trends—to make better business decisions.

<hr class="topic-divider">

### Types of Market Research

**1. Primary Research**

* First-hand data collection (e.g. interviews, surveys, user observations)
* Directly talking to users and sellers

**2. Secondary Research**

* Using data collected by others (e.g. articles, reports, websites)
* Example: Googling “market size of jewelry in India”

<hr class="soft-line">

### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research

| Type         | Focus                      | Example                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Qualitative  | User emotions, motivations | Why people prefer gold jewelry          |
| Quantitative | Measurable data            | 37% of 5,000 people prefer gold jewelry |

## What is User Research?

User research is a part of market research that focuses only on your **users**—their needs, pain points, and how they interact with your product.

### User Research Methods:

* **Surveys**: Collect opinions from many users
* **Usability Testing**: Watch how users use your product
* **Field Studies**: Observe users in real-world settings
* **Persona Development**: Create fictional characters that represent real users
