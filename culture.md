## Measuring and Improving Product Culture

### 1. Quantitative Metrics
- **Team NPS**: Likelihood team members recommend working at the company.
- **Customer Metrics**:
  - CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)
  - Feature adoption rate
- **Experimentation Rate**: How often the team tests new ideas.

### 2. Qualitative Feedback
- Use surveys, 1:1 meetings, and open team discussions to uncover culture gaps.

### 3. Treat Culture Like a Product
- Run small culture experiments (e.g., new meeting formats, feedback loops).
- Measure impact → Iterate → Improve team experience.
