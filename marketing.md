# Understanding Marketing

Marketing is more than just advertising. It’s about understanding what customers want, predicting their needs, and delivering products that meet those needs—while also making a profit.

For product managers, this means going beyond building a great product. You must also make sure it fits well in the market and reaches the right audience.

## Marketing Funnel

The marketing funnel outlines the stages customers go through before making a purchase:

1. **Awareness** – They learn your product exists.
2. **Interest** – They become curious and seek information.
3. **Desire** – They begin to want the product.
4. **Action** – They decide to make a purchase.

This helps PMs design features and marketing efforts for every stage of the customer journey.

## Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs

This model explains five levels of human motivation:

1. **Physiological Needs** – Basic survival needs (food, shelter, water).
2. **Safety Needs** – Security, stability, protection.
3. **Social Needs** – Belonging, love, community.
4. **Esteem Needs** – Recognition, respect, confidence.
5. **Self-Actualization** – Personal growth, achieving potential.

Understanding this helps PMs build products that fulfill both functional and emotional needs.
