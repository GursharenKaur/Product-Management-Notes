# Prioritization: Making Tough Choices

<hr class="section-break">

## Why is Prioritization Important?

- Every team has **limited resources**—time, money, people.
- As a Product Manager, your job is to **decide what to build first**.
- Prioritization ensures:
  - Maximum value to users and the business.
  - Less wasted effort.
  - Faster progress toward goals.

## Prioritization Frameworks

### 1. Value vs. Effort

- **Value** = Benefit to users or business (score 1–10)  
- **Effort** = Resources or time required (score 1–10)

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on **high-value, low-effort** features.
- Avoid **low-value, high-effort** items.

### 2. MoSCoW Framework

Breaks features into:

- **Must Have** – Essential to function.
- **Should Have** – Important but not urgent.
- **Could Have** – Nice to have, if time allows.
- **Won’t Have (for now)** – Not a priority.

Useful for **quick sorting** of what’s critical.

### 3. Kano Model

Categorizes features based on **user satisfaction**:

- **Basic** – Must be included; expected by users.
- **Performance** – Better performance = happier users.
- **Delighters** – Bonus features that surprise and delight.

**Prioritize in this order:**
1. Basic  
2. Performance  
3. Delighters (if resources permit)

### 4. RICE Framework

Considers 4 factors:

- **Reach** – How many users it affects
- **Impact** – How much value it creates
- **Confidence** – How sure you are
- **Effort** – Time/resources needed

**RICE Score** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

| Feature                  | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|--------------------------|:-----:|:------:|:----------:|:------:|:----------:|
| Two-factor authentication | 80   |   5    |    90%     |   20   |     18     |
| Apple Pay integration     | 70   |   4    |    80%     |   25   |     9      |
| Reskin shopping cart      | 60   |   3    |    70%     |   15   |    8.4     |
| Guest checkout            | 50   |   2    |    60%     |   10   |     6      |

**Top Priority**: Two-factor authentication – high impact and reach with reasonable effort.

### 5. Gut Feeling + Data

- Always use **data and feedback** when possible.
- But when data is missing, **PM judgment** plays a role.
- Best results come from a **balance of evidence and intuition**.

## Best Practices for Prioritization

- **Use Data**: Rely on real user feedback and research.
- **Involve Stakeholders**: Collaborate with design, engineering, and leadership.
- **Communicate Clearly**: Share your reasoning and criteria.
- **Stay Flexible**: Re-evaluate priorities as conditions change.
