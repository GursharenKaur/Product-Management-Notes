# What is a PRD?

A **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** is like a **blueprint** for building a product or feature.

It outlines:

- What needs to be built  
- Why it’s being built  
- How success will be measured  

A good PRD ensures that the entire team is aligned throughout the development process.

## Why is a PRD Important?

- **Alignment** – Keeps engineers, designers, and stakeholders on the same page  
- **Transparency** – Reduces confusion by clearly stating the "what" and "why"  
- **Facilitates Discussion** – Becomes the base for team questions, feedback, and improvements  
- **Team Involvement** – Makes everyone feel connected and responsible for the outcome

## Key Components of a PRD

Let’s break down a PRD into **six essential building blocks**:

<hr class="soft-line">

### 1. Problem Statement  
**Purpose:** Define the *why* behind building this feature/product.

- What problem are we solving?  
- Why does it matter to users or the business?  
- Should be brief, clear, and insight-driven

<hr class="soft-line">

### 2. User Stories  
**Purpose:** Explain the product from the user’s perspective.

- Written in the format:  
  `"As a [user], I want to [do something] so that I can [achieve a goal]."`  
- Keeps the team user-focused and outcome-driven

<hr class="soft-line">

### 3. Use Cases  
**Purpose:** Describe how the user will interact with the product.

- Real-life scenarios that walk through user actions  
- Useful for mapping the user journey and designing workflows

<hr class="soft-line">

### 4. Functional Requirements  
**Purpose:** Define the core product functionality.

- What the product will do  
- Serves as a clear checklist for developers and testers

<hr class="soft-line">

### 5. Non-functional Requirements  
**Purpose:** Cover *how* the product should perform.

- Performance (speed, load time)  
- Security (user data protection)  
- Data Handling (storage, migration)  
- Testing & Rollout (QA process, release strategy)  

These are often overlooked but critical to real-world success

<hr class="soft-line">

### 6. Success Metrics  
**Purpose:** Define how you’ll measure if the product works.

Examples:

- Increase in daily active users  
- Drop in support tickets or complaints  
- Faster task completion  

Set metrics before launch to evaluate impact accurately

## Tools for Writing PRDs

Here are some platforms commonly used to create and manage PRDs:

| Tool             | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Confluence**   | Popular for storing and collaborating on PRDs    |
| **Google Docs**  | Simple and flexible for live feedback            |
| **Notion**       | Clean layout with easy structuring and linking   |
| **AI Tools**     | Use generative AI for drafting, formatting, etc. |

Regardless of the tool, the **goal** is to keep the PRD:

- Clear  
- Collaborative  
- Actionable
