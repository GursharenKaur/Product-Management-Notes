## What is Design Thinking?

Design Thinking is a **user-centered approach** to solving problems.

- Focuses on understanding user needs first.
- Helps find the right problems before building solutions.

As a **Product Manager (PM)**:
- Your job is to define the problem clearly.
- Designers work on shaping the solution.
- Both PMs and designers collaborate closely to create meaningful products.

<hr class="topic-divider">

## Why is Design Thinking Important?

- Ensures the product solves **real** user problems.
- Encourages **creative and innovative thinking**.

## The Design Thinking Process

<hr class="topic-divider">

## Iterative Nature of Design Thinking

- It's not a strict linear process.
- You often loop between stages.
- Example: Testing may uncover new problems and lead you back to redefining the problem.

> This flexibility ensures the solution truly fits user needs.

<hr class="topic-divider">

## Working with Designers and UX Researchers

- PMs help **frame the problem**; designers help **craft the solution**.
- Involve designers and UX researchers **early**, not just during execution.
- Encourage a **collaborative team mindset** for better results.

> Great solutions come from shared understanding and teamwork.

- They help keep the process smooth, teams aligned, and problems solved quickly.
