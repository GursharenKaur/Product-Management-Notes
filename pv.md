# Defining the "Why": Product Vision

A **product vision** explains *why* a product exists and what it aims to achieve in the long run.

- It gives the whole team — including developers, designers, and stakeholders — a clear goal to work toward.
- It acts as a guiding direction, helping teams make decisions that match user needs and business goals.

## Comparison Table: Company Vision vs. Product Vision

| Aspect         | Company Vision                                                 | Product Vision                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Describes the overall mission and future goals of the company. | Describes what a specific product aims to do and why it matters.      |
| **Focus**      | Broad focus — covers the entire company.                       | Narrow focus — specific to one product and its users.                 |
| **Example**    | "To be earth's most customer-centric company..." (Amazon)      | "Paper is... the inspiration for the Kindle of the future..." (Amazon Kindle) |
